## Participant Lectures

The professional program consists of lectures by participants lasting 25-40 minutes on selected topics. The lecture and subsequent discussion usually take place in English (if you require Czech, please email [mail](mailto:skolavprirode@karlin.mff.cuni.cz)). Giving a lecture is mandatory for undergraduate and graduate students. Each speaker must prepare a short abstract of 5-10 lines (plain text, basic LaTeX commands can be used) and send it to [Michael Kompascher](mailto:kompatscher@karlin.mff.cuni.cz) in advance.
