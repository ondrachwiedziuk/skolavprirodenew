## Archive
Every entry in archive has to be in separate files in `_archiv` named `year-month-day-type.md` where `year`,`month`, `day` are date when event started.

In each archive entry has to be front matter in this format:
```yml
title_cs: "Podzimní škola 2021"
title_en: "Fall school 2021"
start_date: "4.11. 2021"
end_date: "7.11. 2021"
venue: "Horská chata Lucký vrch"
place: "Telecí"
attendies: "~41"
abstracts_link: "/abstrakty.pdf"
photo_link: "/fotky/"
```

- You can use markdown in `title_cs`, `title_en`, `venue` and `place` attributes.
- `abstracts_link` and `photo_link` has to be URL.
- You can use `~` in `attendies` attribute. It will turn in `asi ` in cs environment and `about ` in en environment.
